Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and Recursive Queries
   - CTE (Common Table Expression)**: A temporary result set that can be referenced within a query.
     Example:
       WITH HighSalary AS (
           SELECT name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > 70000
       )
       SELECT * FROM HighSalary;
       -- Retrieves employees with a salary greater than 70,000 using a CTE.

   - Recursive CTE: A CTE that references itself, useful for hierarchical data (e.g., organizational charts).
     Example:
       WITH RECURSIVE OrgChart AS (
           SELECT id, name, manager_id
           FROM employees WHERE manager_id IS NULL
           UNION ALL
           SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id
           FROM employees e
           INNER JOIN OrgChart o ON e.manager_id = o.id
       )
       SELECT * FROM OrgChart;
       -- Recursively retrieves employees and their managers.
