Joins: Inner, Outer (Left, Right, Full), Cross Joins
   - Inner Join: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
     Example (Real-World):
       SELECT orders.id, customers.name
       FROM orders
       INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id;
       -- Retrieves all orders with corresponding customer names.

   - Left Join: Returns all records from the left table, and matched records from the right table.
     Example (Real-World):
       SELECT customers.name, orders.id
       FROM customers
       LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;
       -- Retrieves all customers, including those with no orders.

   - Right Join: Returns all records from the right table, and matched records from the left table.
     Example (Real-World):
       SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
       FROM employees
       RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
       -- Retrieves all departments, including those with no employees.

   - Full Join: Returns all records when thereâ€™s a match in either left or right table.
     Example (Real-World):
       SELECT employees.name, projects.project_name
       FROM employees
       FULL JOIN projects ON employees.project_id = projects.id;
       -- Retrieves all employees and all projects, matching where possible.

   - Cross Join: Returns the Cartesian product of two tables (every combination of rows).
     Example (Real-World):
       SELECT products.name, promotions.promo_name
       FROM products
       CROSS JOIN promotions;
       -- Combines every product with every promotion.
