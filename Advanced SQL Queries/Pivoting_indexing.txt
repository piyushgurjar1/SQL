Pivoting and Unpivoting Data
   - Pivoting: Turns rows into columns to create a more readable format (often used in reporting).
     Example:
       SELECT 
           department,
           SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'Male' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS male_count,
           SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'Female' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS female_count
       FROM employees
       GROUP BY department;
       -- Pivot employees by department, showing counts of males and females.

   - Unpivoting: Converts columns into rows (opposite of pivoting).
     Example 
       SELECT department, gender, count
       FROM ( 
           SELECT department, male_count, female_count
           FROM employee_counts
       ) AS pivoted_data
       UNPIVOT (
           count FOR gender IN (male_count, female_count)
       ) AS unpivoted_data;
       -- Converts the male and female counts into rows instead of columns.
