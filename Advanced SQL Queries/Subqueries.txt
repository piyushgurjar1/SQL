Subqueries and Correlated Subqueries
   - Subquery: A query inside another query that returns a single value or set of values.
     Example :
       SELECT name, salary
       FROM employees
       WHERE department_id = (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE name = 'Sales');
       -- Finds employees who work in the 'Sales' department.

   - Correlated Subquery: A subquery that references a column from the outer query.
     Example :
       SELECT e.name, e.salary
       FROM employees e
       WHERE e.salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = e.department_id);
       -- Retrieves employees whose salary is above the average salary in their department.
