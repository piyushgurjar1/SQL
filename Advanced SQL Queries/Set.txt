Set Operations: UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT
   - UNION: Combines the result sets of two queries and removes duplicates.
     Example (Real-World):
       SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR'
       UNION
       SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';
       -- Combines lists of employees from HR and Sales departments, without duplicates.

   - INTERSECT: Returns common results between two queries.
     Example (Real-World):
       SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales'
       INTERSECT
       SELECT name FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
       -- Retrieves employees who work in Sales and have a salary greater than 50,000.

   - EXCEPT: Returns records from the first query that arenâ€™t in the second query.
     Example (Real-World):
       SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales'
       EXCEPT
       SELECT name FROM employees WHERE salary < 50000;
       -- Retrieves employees from Sales department with salaries greater than or equal to 50,000.
