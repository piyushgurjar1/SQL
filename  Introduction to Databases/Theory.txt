Introduction to Databases

History & Evolution of Databases
- 1960s-1970s: Flat files and simple data storage.
- 1970s: Introduction of the Relational Model.
- 1980s-1990s: Rise of SQL databases like MySQL, Oracle, and MS SQL Server.
- 2000s: Emergence of NoSQL databases (like MongoDB, Cassandra) to handle big data and more complex use cases.

Types of Databases
1. Relational Databases (SQL)
   - Data is stored in tables (rows and columns).
   - Uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to interact with data.
   - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite.
   - Best for: Structured data and transactions (banking, e-commerce).

2. Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)
   - Data is stored in key-value pairs, documents, graphs, etc.
   - More flexible than relational databases.
   - Example: MongoDB.
   - Best for: Unstructured data, high scalability, and big data applications.

What is a DBMS?
A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that helps you create, manage, and interact with databases.
- It helps store data securely.
- Manages access, ensuring data is consistent, accurate, and available when needed.
Examples of DBMS: MySQL, MongoDB, Oracle.

SQL vs. NoSQL
- SQL: Structured, uses tables, predefined schemas. Works best for complex queries and transactions.
  - Use SQL if we need consistent, relational data.
- NoSQL: Flexible schema, works great for large-scale data that doesn't fit properly into tables.
  - Use NoSQL if we need scalability and flexibility.
